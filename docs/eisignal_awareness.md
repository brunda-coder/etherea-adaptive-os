# EI Signals & Emotional Awareness

This document explains how Etherea understands the user’s emotional and mental state
using **EI (Emotional Intelligence) signals**, without invading privacy.

This is written for beginners.

---

## 1. What are EI Signals?

EI signals are **indirect indicators** of how a user might be feeling.

They are NOT emotions.
They are **patterns**.

Examples:
- Working continuously without breaks
- Rapid app switching
- Long idle time
- Sudden task abandonment

These signals help the system respond gently.

---

## 2. What EI Signals Are NOT

EI signals are NOT:
- mind reading
- spying
- emotion labels like “sad” or “angry”
- medical diagnosis

Etherea never *decides* emotions.
It only **observes patterns**.

---

## 3. Why EI Signals Are Needed

Without EI signals:
- System feels robotic
- Same behavior in all situations
- No emotional intelligence

With EI signals:
- Avatar changes tone
- System suggests breaks
- UI becomes calmer during stress
- Focus help becomes meaningful

EI signals make Etherea feel human-centered.

## 4. Types of EI Signals Used

### A. Interaction Signals
- typing speed
- mouse movement patterns
- app switching frequency

### B. Time Signals
- session length
- break gaps
- late-night usage

### C. Feedback Signals
- user accepting suggestions
- user rejecting changes
- manual overrides

---

## 5. What Data is NOT Collected

For privacy, Etherea NEVER stores:
- raw microphone audio
- camera recordings
- private messages
- biometric data
- passwords

Only **processed, consented signals** are allowed.

---

## 6. Consent Rules (Very Important)

- User chooses what to enable
- Each signal has an ON/OFF switch
- User can disable anytime
- No hidden tracking

Consent is part of the system design,
not a checkbox.

---

## 7. How the System Responds to EI Signals

When signals indicate stress:
- UI becomes simpler
- Avatar speaks softly
- Notifications reduce

When signals indicate focus:
- System avoids interruptions
- Suggestions are delayed

Responses are:
- explainable
- reversible
- respectful

---

## 8. Ethical Design Principle

EI signals exist to:
- support the user
- reduce pressure
- increase clarity

They must never:
- judge the user
- label the user
- force behavior

---

## 9. Beginner Summary

- EI signals = patterns, not emotions
- Privacy always comes first
- User is always in control
- System suggests, never forces

This is the emotional foundation of Etherea.
