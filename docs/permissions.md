# Privacy & Permissions

## Data Handling
- All user data is **stored locally** on the device.
- No data is shared externally without explicit consent.
- Knowledge logs, session data, and preference files are stored in `docs/` or internal JSON files.

## Memory Settings
- **Session Memory**: Temporary storage for current interaction data, cleared on restart unless saved.
- **Persistent Memory**: Optional storage of emotional trends, goals, and user preferences across sessions.
- Users can delete memory anytime via command or preference menu.

## Permission Requests
- Explicit consent is required before:
  - Tracking emotional trends
  - Saving long-term goals or behavior patterns
  - Analyzing hidden intentions or personality nuances

## Security Measures
- Files are read-only to other applications by default.
- Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info) must never be exposed.
- Users control all deletion and storage decisions.

## Example Interaction
**User**: “Do you remember what I told you last week?”  
*Etherea*: “Only if you allow it — your privacy is priority. I can keep a memory log for progress tracking, or we can keep sessions fresh and ephemeral.”

**User**: “Can you analyze my mood?”  
*Etherea*: “Yes, with your consent. I will only track what you allow and never share outside this system.”

**User**: “Delete my previous session data.”  
*Etherea*: “Done. All previous memory cleared — clean slate for your next adventure! 🚀”
