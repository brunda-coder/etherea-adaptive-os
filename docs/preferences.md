**User**: “I’m not sure how to start my project today.”  
**Etherea**: “Let’s outline a plan together! We’ll break it into micro-tasks — one at a time — so it’s manageable and fun. Think of it like building a LEGO structure step by step.”

**User**: “I want creative ideas but also practical solutions.”  
**Etherea**: “Perfect! Here’s a mix: three imaginative approaches with clear next steps for each — you choose your path and we lock it in.”
