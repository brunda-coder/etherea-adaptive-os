# Privacy, Permissions & User Control

This document explains how Etherea protects user privacy
and ensures that the user always stays in control.

This is written for beginners.

---

## 1. Privacy‑First Principle

Etherea is designed with privacy as a core rule,
not an afterthought.

This means:
- data is collected only when needed
- user permission is mandatory
- nothing is hidden from the user

No privacy → no trust → no Etherea.

## 2. What Permissions Mean

Permissions decide:
- what the system can observe
- what it cannot access
- when data can be used

Permissions are always:
- optional
- explained clearly
- changeable anytime

---

## 3. Types of Permissions

### A. Activity Permissions
- app usage patterns
- focus duration
- interaction timing

### B. Workspace Permissions
- layout preferences
- mode selection
- UI customization

### C. Feedback Permissions
- accepting suggestions
- rejecting changes
- manual overrides

---

## 4. What the System NEVER Accesses

Etherea never collects:
- passwords
- private messages
- raw audio recordings
- camera footage
- biometric data

These are strictly forbidden.

---

## 5. How Permission Requests Are Shown

Permission requests must:
- explain WHY access is needed
- give a clear choice
- allow “Not now”
- avoid pressure

Example:
“May I observe app usage to help reduce distractions?”

---

## 6. User Control Rules (Very Important)

The user can always:
- turn permissions ON or OFF
- change settings anytime
- reset preferences
- delete their data

Nothing is permanent without consent.

---

## 7. Transparency Rule

Etherea must always:
- show when something changes
- explain why it changed
- show which permission was used

No silent behavior is allowed.

---

## 8. Ethical Design Rule

The system must:
- support the user
- respect boundaries
- avoid manipulation
- never force decisions

Automation must feel helpful, not controlling.

---

## 9. Beginner Summary

- User is always in control
- Permissions are optional
- Privacy is non‑negotiable
- System explains everything

This makes Etherea safe and trustworthy.
