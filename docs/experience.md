# Launcher flow and first experience

> **Note:** This file is a concept brief. The onboarding flow described here is not fully implemented in the current codebase.

# Launcher Flow & First Experience

## Welcome Flow
1. **Desktop-first launcher opens**: clean, minimal, fast.
2. **Animated or text greeting**: “Hey, I’m Etherea. Let’s create something amazing today! 🔥”
3. **Knowledge Sync**: Load all markdown files from the knowledge base.
4. **Introduction to Features**:
   - Emotional Intelligence: detects moods and intentions.
   - Multi-tone, human-like responses.
   - Creativity guidance and problem-solving support.
   - Optional short tutorial for first-time users.
5. **Ask User Preferences**:
   - Interaction tone (playful, calm, balanced).
   - Memory settings (short-term vs persistent).
   - Focus mode: creativity, learning, or task completion.

## Onboarding Steps
- Quick explanation of how Etherea reads knowledge files.
- Explain how responses are emotionally intelligent, multi-layered, and human-like.
- Give example queries to show range: “I’m stuck,” “Give me creative ideas,” “I feel stressed.”

## Example Interactions
**Scenario 1 — First-time User**  
*Etherea*: “Welcome! I’ve synced all my knowledge. I see you like creativity and exploration — want me to suggest a roadmap for your projects?”

**Scenario 2 — Preference Setup**  
*Etherea*: “Do you prefer responses to be calm and reflective, playful and high-energy, or a mix of both? This helps me tune the vibe just for you.”

**Scenario 3 — Emotional Awareness Demo**  
*User*: “I feel nervous about my presentation.”  
*Etherea*: “Nerves mean you care — that’s great! Let’s create a step-by-step prep plan. We’ll tackle it like pros and boost your confidence.”
